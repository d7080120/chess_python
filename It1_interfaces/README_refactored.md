# Chess Game - Refactored Architecture 🎮

## Overview
This chess game has been refactored from a monolithic 868-line `Game.py` file into a clean, modular architecture following SOLID principles.

## 🏗️ New Architecture

### Core Components

| Component | Responsibility | File |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| 🎮 **GameRefactored** | Main game coordination and loop | `GameRefactored.py` |
| 📁 **InputHandler** | Keyboard input processing | `InputHandler.py` |
| 👥 **PlayerManager** | Player cursor and piece selection | `PlayerManager.py` |
| 🎨 **DrawManager** | Graphics rendering and display | `DrawManager.py` |
| ⚔️ **CaptureHandler** | Piece captures and pawn promotion | `CaptureHandler.py` |
| 🏆 **WinChecker** | Victory condition detection | `WinChecker.py` |
| 🔍 **MoveValidator** | Move legality validation | `MoveValidator.py` |

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle**
Each class has one clear purpose and responsibility.

### ✅ **Better Testability** 
24 unit tests covering all components individually.

### ✅ **Improved Maintainability**
Changes to one component don't affect others.

### ✅ **Enhanced Readability**
Code is organized and easier to understand.

### ✅ **Future Extensibility**
Easy to add new features without breaking existing code.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
- **Player 1 (White pieces)**: Numeric keys
  - `8` = Up, `2` = Down, `4` = Left, `6` = Right
  - `5`, `0`, or `Enter` = Select piece
  
- **Player 2 (Black pieces)**: WASD keys  
  - `W` = Up, `S` = Down, `A` = Left, `D` = Right
  - `Space` = Select piece

- **Exit**: `ESC` or `Q`

### Running the Game

#### Option 1: New Refactored Version
```bash
python main_refactored.py
```

#### Option 2: Updated Original Main
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
python -m pytest test_refactored_pytest.py test_integration_pytest.py -v
```

Run specific test categories:
```bash
# Unit tests
python -m pytest test_refactored_pytest.py -v

# Integration tests  
python -m pytest test_integration_pytest.py -v
```

## 📊 Before vs After

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Files** | 1 monolithic file (868 lines) | 7 focused classes (~100-150 lines each) |
| **Testability** | Hard to test | 24 comprehensive unit tests |
| **Maintainability** | Risky changes | Safe, isolated changes |
| **Readability** | Complex, mixed concerns | Clean, single responsibilities |
| **Extensibility** | Difficult | Easy to extend |

## 🚀 Future Extensions

The new architecture makes it easy to extend:

- **AI Player**: Extend `PlayerManager`
- **Better Graphics**: Replace `DrawManager`  
- **Network Play**: Extend `InputHandler`
- **Different Rules**: Modify `MoveValidator`
- **Sound Effects**: Add `SoundManager`
- **Game Replay**: Add `ReplayManager`

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Features

1. Identify which component should handle the new feature
2. Extend the appropriate class or create a new one
3. Add tests for the new functionality
4. Update the main game coordinator if needed

### Testing New Changes

```bash
# Run tests to ensure nothing broke
python -m pytest -v

# Run the game to test manually
python main_refactored.py
```

## 🎉 Summary

This refactoring transforms a hard-to-maintain monolithic chess game into a clean, modular, and extensible architecture. Each component has a clear responsibility, making the code easier to understand, test, and modify.

**The game functionality remains exactly the same**, but now it's built on a solid, maintainable foundation that will make future development much easier and safer.
